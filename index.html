        <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h1>
        <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
        <p>
            You're looking at a command-line interface (CLI), which is an interface in which you can write and execute... commands! But this one isn't like the others, this one is made by me! It uses fairly simplistic JavaScript code along with some php which can be found <a href="https://code.xpple.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The purpose of this CLI isn't anything serious. The commands are mostly for entertainment.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you keep track of the commands I execute?</h2>
        <p>
            No, with a few exceptions. Since I mostly use Javascript, the commands you execute are executed on your end. However, some commands require server-sided code. This means the php requests will be visible to me. Keep in mind that the results of any command will never be visible to me, as they are presented to you with JavaScript. For transparency, you may click <a href="https://code.xpple.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to see the server-sided code.

        <p>
            I'm xpple, also known as Fred. I mostly code in Java and JavaScript, but I've done a bit of everything. I wouldn't consider myself particularly good at any of these languages, but I find it enjoyable to code.

            I currently study applied mathematics, which is something I enjoy too.
