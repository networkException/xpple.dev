			sudokupy is a sudoku AI written in Python. Unlike other solvers, it doesn't rely on backtracking algorithms.
			This solver only uses human logic to solve the puzzle. While this might not be the most efficient way to code
			a solver, it is certainly the more challenging way.
		</p>
		<h2 class="jetbrains">Code breakdown</h2>
		<p class="jetbrains">
			Although I did add quite a lot of comments to the code, the comments I added weren't really explanatory.
			Here I will break the code down into much more detail.
		</p>
		<h3 class="jetbrains">sudoku.json</h3>
		<p class="jetbrains">
			The input sudoku is stored in a json file. The input is quite verbose, which is to assure the order of the
			input sudoku is maintained.
		</p>
		<h3 class="jetbrains">sudoku_loader.py</h3>
		<p class="jetbrains">
			Here the input sudoku is transformed into a three dimensional array. For each row in the input, I add a new
			array to the sudoku array. In the next loop, I add the values of each cell to that newly added array.
			Technically I could have stopped here. However, since this solver relies on only sudoku logic, I added
			another array to this new array, which is for the booleans of each cell. Then in the last loop, I set all
			the booleans to True, as a default value.
